The EndoVis2018 Surgical Equipment Segmentation dataset was made available as part of the Endoscopic Vision Challenge at the MICCAI 2018 conference. This dataset may be used to create and assess algorithms that accurately segment surgical tools in endoscopic images. The dataset, which includes 569 validation and 1679 annotated training endoscopic pictures, represents real-world situations that arise during minimally invasive treatments. These images, which include surgical tools of eight (BG + seven classses) for segmentation, include challenges such as obstacles, uneven illumination, and complex instrument forms that may be used to gauge how robust the segmentation model is.
